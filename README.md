Topic: CSS Syntax and Selectors

The general syntax of CSS is: selector { property: value; }

Selectors are used to select HTML elements to apply specific styles. There are three main types: ID, Class, and Element selectors.

â†’ ID Selector: Targets a unique element. It is written using #, for example: #header.

â†’ Class Selector: Targets multiple elements with the same class. It is written using ., for example: .box.

â†’ Element Selector: Directly targets HTML tags such as <h1>, <p>, <div>, etc.

Selectors help us apply different styles to specific parts of the webpage effectively.


Day 8:  
17 - 07 - 2025 (Thursday)  
Topic: CSS Colors, Fonts, and Units

In CSS, we use different properties to style text and layout using colors, fonts, and measurement units.

â†’ Colors: CSS supports color names (red, blue), HEX codes (#ff0000), RGB (rgb(255,0,0)), and HSL formats.

â†’ Fonts: We use font-family to apply fonts like Arial, Verdana, or Google Fonts. We can also set bold or italic using font-weight and font-style.

â†’ Units:
- px (pixels): Fixed-size units.
- em: Relative to the parentâ€™s font size.
- rem: Relative to the root elementâ€™s font size.
- % (percent): Relative to the parent container size.

Using the right fonts, colors, and units improves both the *appearance* and *responsiveness* of a web page.


Day 9:  
18 - 07 - 2025 (Friday)  
Topic: CSS Box Model

The CSS Box Model describes how every HTML element is structured and spaced in the layout.

It consists of the following parts (from inside out):

â†’ Content: The actual text or image inside the element.  
â†’ Padding: Space between the content and the border (inside the box).  
â†’ Border: The edge surrounding the padding and content.  
â†’ Margin: Space outside the element that separates it from other elements.

Each part can be styled using CSS properties like margin, padding, border, and width/height.

Understanding the box model is essential for controlling *spacing, **alignment, and **layout design* effectively.



Day 10:  
19 - 07 - 2025 (Saturday)  
Topic: CSS Display Types

The `display` property in CSS controls how an element is rendered on the page.

â†’ block: Takes up the full width available (e.g., <div>, <p>). Starts on a new line.

â†’ inline: Takes up only as much width as needed (e.g., <span>, <a>). Stays within the line.

â†’ inline-block: Behaves like inline but allows setting width, height, padding, and margin.

â†’ flex: Enables a flexible box layout. It allows easy alignment and distribution of items using `display: flex`.

â†’ grid: Provides a two-dimensional layout system for arranging items in rows and columns using `display: grid`.

Choosing the right display type helps control element behavior and structure the layout properly.



Day 11:  
21 - 07 - 2025 (Monday)  
Topic: CSS Flexbox Layout

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model used to align and distribute space among items in a container.

To use Flexbox, we set the containerâ€™s `display` to `flex`:
â†’ display: flex; â€“ enables flexbox on the container.

Main properties for layout control:
â†’ justify-content: Aligns items horizontally (e.g., center, space-between, space-around).  
â†’ align-items: Aligns items vertically (e.g., center, flex-start, flex-end).  
â†’ flex-direction: Sets the direction of the flex items (row, column).  
â†’ gap: Adds spacing between items.

Flexbox helps build responsive layouts with clean alignment and spacing, especially for navigation bars and cards.



Day 12:  
22 - 07 - 2025 (Tuesday)  
Topic: CSS Grid Layout

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system used to arrange items in rows and columns with precision.

To activate Grid, we use: `display: grid;` on the container.

Key properties used in Grid layout:
â†’ grid-template-columns: Defines the number and size of columns (e.g., 1fr 1fr for two equal columns).  
â†’ grid-template-rows: Defines row heights.  
â†’ gap: Sets space between rows and columns.  
â†’ grid-column / grid-row: Specifies how many columns or rows an item should span.  
â†’ place-items: Shorthand to align items both vertically and horizontally (like `center`, `start`, `end`).

CSS Grid is ideal for creating complex layouts like galleries, dashboards, and structured page sections.



Day 13:  
23 - 07 - 2025 (Wednesday)  
Topic: Media Queries (Responsive Design)

Media queries allow us to apply different CSS styles based on the deviceâ€™s screen size or resolution.

Syntax example:  
@media (max-width: 768px) {  
â€ƒbody { font-size: 14px; }  
}

Key uses of media queries:
â†’ Adjust font size, layout, or spacing for mobile devices.  
â†’ Create mobile-first designs that scale up for larger screens.  
â†’ Use breakpoints like 600px (mobile), 768px (tablet), and 1024px+ (desktop).

Media queries help create responsive websites that look good on all devices, from phones to large screens.
